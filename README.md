# Poised Project (Database Version)
## About
Poised Project Database has been refactored and uses databases instead of textfiles to retrieve information. Poised Project Database combines both Java and 
SQL(Structured Query Language) to form Java Database Programming with the core functionality of capturing, updating and finalising projects.
## Functions
This version of the Poised Project has the following features:
* A user can view all the projects from a database as well as add new projects to the database.
* A user can update and finalise any project in the database.
* Allows the user to see a list of projects that are complete, incomplete and overdue.
* Writes the updated details of a project to the database that contains exisiting projects.
* Allows the user to update project details at any time.
* Generates an invoice during the finalisation of a project.
* Poised Project Database runs concurrently with a database in order to gather and format information.
